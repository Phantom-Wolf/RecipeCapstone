Summary:
    Kitchen to Plate is a web application that gives you recipes for meals. The main difference of this app from most other
    recipe web apps is that instead of adding things that you want to see, you exclude what you don't want. This makes it 
    perfect for seeing only the recipes that consider a groups varying dietary needs and preferences. You select ingredients
    to exclude from the exclude dropdown or entire sections of food with the allergy dropdown. Each recipe will give serving size,
    time to make, wine paring(if available), ingredient list and instructions.

Technology Used:
